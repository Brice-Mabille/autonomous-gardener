# Séance 7

I began this session by making sure the LIDAR system is compatible with the actual LIDAR.

But I didn't anticipate that the LIDAR would be too long for the printed system. Because I will have a model and a structure, it will at least assist me in recreating the LIDAR system.

So I begun to modelize the new LIDAR system, I thought I only needed to do a dilation but it will not work because the parts connected to the motors don't have to be change.

I believe I will lengthen the system's base and rings, and I may dilate the remaining portions.

It took a lot of time because I didn't know how to change a mesh in a solid I could modify.

Next, Jaime and I decided to take a Linkedin picture to show the advance of our robot.

Second, I connected the Auger and Gear systems to the motors and saw that everything appeared to be in order.

I'm just not sure with the reliability of the rack with the motor DC.

I thought of an idea with Jaime, making the rack on a side and a Linear bearing which maintains the rack with the motor and the gear.

I finished the session cutting the seed stock on plexiglas and the goodies with the LASER machine.
